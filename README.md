# do--you-know-me-quiz

This is the CLI quiz app: "Do you know me".

The app asks simple questions from user to test how well they know the developer of this app (me).

The app is built using NodeJS, Readline-sync and Chalk.

I am making this app under the slew of projects covered in Neog.camp level zero.
